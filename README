This project is my attempt to create a messenger.
The idea came out when I was using Telegram. It really inspired me.

8/13/2021 - Beta 1.1:
- fixed blinking of avatars in ChatsFragment
- by now all images are being downloaded into the cache storage during first facing (then they will be loaded from there without internet)
